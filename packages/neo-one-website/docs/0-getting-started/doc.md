## Learn
This site is filled with resources to help you learn about NEO•ONE and dapp development. Whether you're new to developing for NEO or you have experience with other blockchain development tools, we recommend starting with our hands on [courses](/course), [tutorial](/tutorial), or our [step by step guide]() to main concepts. Our goal is to get you up to speed and building dapps as quickly and easily as possible!

### First Examples
The [NEO•ONE Homepage](/) contains a few small examples. Even if you don't know anything about building dapps, check it out to see what is possible.

### Typescript Resources
The NEO•ONE documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in Typescript. If you are familiar with Javascript, or better yet, Javascript with Flow, this should be an easy transition.

We recommend going through this [Javascript overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) to check your knowledge of basic concepts and this [Typescript overview](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) to learn about the differences.

### Courses
The [NEO•ONE courses](/course) are a great place to get started with NEO•ONE. They will walk you through all of the basic concepts of development with NEO•ONE to get your first dapp up and running. Best of all, they run on a completely in the browser, so no environment setup is required. We recommend this as the fastest and easiest way to get started.

### Tutorial
If you'd prefer to use your own editor and setup your own environment, the [NEO•ONE tutorial](/tutorial) is also a great place to start.  The tutorials cover the same content as the courses and give you step by step instructions on how to get your environment setup on your local machine.

### Main Concepts
If you'd prefer to just get an overview of NEO•ONE and learn about some of the core concepts, keep reading this documentation or skip ahead to the [main concepts]() section.

### Advanced Concepts
Once you're comfortable with the [main concepts]() and have built some simple dapps with NEO•ONE, you might be interested in some of the more advanced features NEO•ONE has to offer. The [advanced concepts]() section will introduce you to some of the less commonly used features.

### API Reference
The [API Reference]() section is useful for learning about specific details of the NEO•ONE API.
