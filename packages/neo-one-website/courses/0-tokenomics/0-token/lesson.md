# Welcome!

So you want to create your own Token? Maybe even hold an ICO to raise millions? Well you've come to the right place. This course will teach you how to do all of that and more on the NEO blockchain.

Throughout the course we'll be using TypeScript. It's not necessary to have prior experience with TypeScript, but you may want to keep the TypeScript [documentation](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) handy. We'll also include links to the TypeScript handbook throughout the documentation.
